=head1 CPAN Definitive Tags

=head2 Introduction

CPAN packages can specify B<keywords> (also known as B<tags> or B<labels>)
in their META.yml to provide guidelines for indexing a module. This document
will list some B<"definitive" tags> which will be agreed upon to qualify
some meta-data about the module for easy categorisation.

Unless noted otherwise, all the definitive tags live in the C<def/*> module
where they are used to be separated from other more random tags.

=head2 List of tags.

=head3 def/active_dev

The module is actively developed.

=head3 def/adopt_me

This means the module is abandoned and up-for-adoption. It probably indicates
that the current maintainer still finds it to be a good and recommended module,
just that they have lost interest, lack the necessary time, or are otherwise
unable to maintain it. 

=head3 def/alt_to_core

"Alternative to core".

This module provides a (hopefully better) alternative to a core module.
Examples: L<File::Next>, L<File::Find::Object>, L<Readonly> 
(alternative to "constant"), L<Module::Build> (alternative to
ExtUtils-MakeMaker), L<Module::Starter> (alternative to h2xs),
L<Sub::Exporter> (alternative to Exporter.pm).

=head3 def/black_magic

Like Magic only something that is considered "Evil". Possible examples are
source filters and the CPAN L<Error> distribution. Also see C<def/magic>.

=head3 def/deprecated

The module is present and may be maintained, but is not recommended for general
use. 

=head3 def/linux_only

=head3 def/macosx_only

=head3 def/maintained

=head3 def/non_final_api
