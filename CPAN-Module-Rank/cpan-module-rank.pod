=head1 CPAN Module-Rank

=head2 Introduction

The CPAN Module-Rank aims to be an automatically calculated metric for CPAN
modules similar in purpose, but not in implementation to Google's
L<PageRank|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank>. When we say it's
automatically calculated it does not mean the data it is based on was not
generated by humans. Even Google relies on the mostly human-generated web to
build its index, but like Google's search results the Module-Rank calculation
for a given query will not require human intervention.

=head3 Update: Manual Enhancement of Search Results

I recall seeing a L<Slashdot|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot> feature
that noted that Google has a team of (human) employees who help enhance the search
results, and that a document with guidelines for their work has been found.

We can follow Google's lead and enhance some common searches using manual,
contributor-specified, tweaks.

=head2 Parameters for Discussion

=head3 Last update date

L<Not fully indicative|http://perl.plover.com/yak/12views/samples/notes.html#sl-9>, but still a useful parameter.

=head3 Average activity over time. (How many releases and how frequently)

A-la-Freshmeat.

=head3 CPANTS Kwalitee Score

Or specific metrics.

=head3 CPAN Testers

This is hard to determine. Sometimes a program break due to the assumptions of the development system. (Such as only Linux or only Mac OS X).

=head3 Number of incoming references/dependecies in (WWW, CPAN, etc.)

PageRank/citations-like.

=head3 CPAN Ratings/Reviews.

=head3 Test coverage.

=head3 Author tagging/categorising/marking.

=head3 User-contributed tagging/categorising/marking.

=head3 Total number of reported bugs (both open and closed)

The more bugs people have reported for a module, the it is indicative that people are using it. We shouldn't judge based on open bugs alone, because that will encourage people to keep them open.
